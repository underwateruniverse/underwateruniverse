<h1>underwater universe </h1>
<p>Dive into the experience </p>
</body>   A small band from a small town band. Many don't know us but we wish to spread our love of the water and space with all. Space and the ocean have so much left to discover, so why not experience it together. Our hope is to inspire others like us to explore more and lisening to music also inspired by the ocean and the many galaxies. The music fuse haunting melodies with dreamy harmonies with a recognizable beat. With a harm or cold sound that is good in any weather or mood. The skillful harmonies tell some of the untold stories around us.
